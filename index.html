            <p class="secSubTag textsmall">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                preceptor after initiation.[27] The education was
                delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students /diciples) was very
                important part
                of the education.[28] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher
                learning institute in
                India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university
                or not in modern
                sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                there did not seem
                to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the
                later Nalanda
                university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the
                modern sense of
                university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -PÃ¡li language.[29

            <p class="secTag textbig">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="secSubTag textsmall">According to a survey an estimate, 29% of Indian children were privately
                educated in 2014.[14] With more than 50%
                children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private
                schooling in
                cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in private
                schools.[65]


                La Martiniere Calcutta, a private school in Kolkata
                Most middle-class families send their children to private schools,[65] mostly in their own city, but
                also at boarding
                schools. Private schools have been established since the British Rule in India and St George's School,
                Chennai is the
                oldest private school in India.[66] At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but Hindi
                and/or the
                state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject.[67] Pre-school education is mostly
                limited to
                organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains.[68] Montessori education is also
                popular, due to
                Maria Montessori's stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in
                Chennai were
                Montessori.[69]

                (BOSSE), National Institute of Open Schooling
                (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education.
                1.4 million
                students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance
                learning.[133] In 2012
                various state governments also introduced "State Open School" to provide distance education.[134]

                At higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance
                learning. It has a
                cumulative enrolment of about 1.5 million, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400 study centres
                with 25,000
